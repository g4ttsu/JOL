    <h4>Playing cards & Influencing</h4>
    The <span class="badge bg-secondary fs-6 px-2 py-1">play</span> command is used to play cards from your hand, and
    the <span class="badge bg-secondary fs-6 px-2 py-1">influence</span> command is used to play vampires from your
    uncontrolled region.
    Both of these commands add additional context to the game chat, and setup the initial state of the card, like
    capacity, disciplines, etc.<br/>

    <h4>Drawing cards</h4>
    The best command to use for drawing cards is the <span class="badge bg-secondary fs-6 px-2 py-1">draw</span>
    command. While you can achieve the same result with move, draw provides more context in the game chat.
    <div class="card mt-2">

        </ul>
    </div>
    <hr class="my-4"/>
    <h4>Discarding cards</h4>
    There is a specific <span class="badge bg-secondary fs-6 px-2 py-1">discard</span> command to allow you to discard a
    card from your hand only, with the ability to do this randomly, and the option to replace automatically or not.
    <div class="card mt-2">

    <h4>Burning cards</h4>
    There is a <span class="badge bg-secondary fs-6 px-2 py-1">burn</span> command that will move the card from the
    ready/torpor region into it's owner's ash-heap.
    <div class="card mt-2">

    </div>
    <hr class="my-4"/>
    <h4>Moving cards</h4>
    For all other cases, the <span class="badge bg-secondary fs-6 px-2 py-1">move</span> command will allow you to move
    cards in play from one position ( PLAYER / REGION / CARD ), to another position.
    This command is the most commonly used, and will cover most use-cases inside a game of VTES.
    <div class="card mt-2">
        <div class="card-header">
            <h5 class="mt-2 fs-6">Tips</h5>

            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Keywords <code>prey</code> and <code>predator</code> can be used as a shortcut for
                destination players.
            </li>

    </div>
    <hr class="my-4"/>
    <h4>Shuffling</h4>
    The <span class="badge bg-secondary fs-6 px-2 py-1">shuffle</span> command will shuffle regions, or randomize a
    selection of cards in a region.
